Spring bean scopes are used to manage how beans are created, stored, and accessed in a Spring application. They are important for managing the state and concurrency of beans across requests and sessions. 
Types of bean scopes
Singleton
The default scope, where a single instance of a bean is created and shared across all requests. 
Prototype
A new instance of a bean is created each time it is requested. 
Request
A new instance of a bean is created for each HTTP request. This scope is useful for storing data specific to a request, like user session information. 
Session
A new instance of a bean is created for each user session. This scope maintains the state specific to a user's session across multiple requests. 
Application
A new instance of a bean is created once for the entire application. It is shared across all requests and sessions. 
WebSocket
A new instance of a bean is created for each WebSocket session. This scope is used to create WebSocket applications, like for bidirectional message exchange between client and server. 
You can define the scope of a bean using XML configuration or Java annotations.
