Autowiring, also known as automatic wiring, is a feature of the Spring Framework that automatically injects dependencies into Java classes. It's a part of 
Spring's inversion of control (IoC) container. 
How it works ---
Autowiring matches the types of properties, constructor arguments, or method arguments of the beans.
It eliminates the need for manual configuration.
It reduces the amount of XML configuration.
It makes the code more readable.
Benefits 
It simplifies dependency injection.
It reduces boilerplate code.
It allows developers to focus on writing business logic.
It improves the modularity, testability, and maintainability of Spring applications.
Types of autowiring 
byName: Injects the object dependency according to the name of the bean.
byType: Injects the object dependency according to type.
constructor: Injects the dependency by calling the constructor of the class.
Annotation 
The @Autowired annotation is used to enable autowiring. It can be applied to variables, methods, and constructors.
